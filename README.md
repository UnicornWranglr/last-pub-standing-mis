# Last Pub Standing — MIS

A web-based Management Information System for **Last Pub Standing (LPS)**, replacing a collection of Google Sheets with a single self-owned platform. Phase 1 covers **Daily Takings** and **Events Log** behind a secure login.

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui-style components → deployed on **Vercel**
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express (ESM) → deployed on **Render**
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16 → **Render Postgres**
- **Auth:** JWT + bcrypt, two roles (`owner`, `staff`)

## Access model (owner vs staff)

| Action | Staff | Owner |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| View dashboard, takings, events | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create takings / events | ✅ | ✅ |
| Edit takings / events | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Delete** takings / events | ❌ | ✅ |
| User management (Phase 2) | ❌ | ✅ |

Staff can enter and correct day-to-day records but can't permanently remove financial history — that stays with the owner. Enforced both server-side (`requireRole('owner')` middleware returns 403) and in the UI (delete buttons hidden for staff).

Seeded users (created on first deploy, idempotent):
- **Simon** — owner
- **Daniel** — staff

Passwords are set via `SEED_OWNER_PASSWORD` / `SEED_STAFF_PASSWORD` in Render env vars. Both users should change their passwords after their first login (user-management UI comes in Phase 2; for now, reset by connecting to Postgres directly — see "Managing users" below).

## Deploying to Render + Vercel

### 1 · Push to GitHub
Already done if you're reading this.

### 2 · Deploy the API + database on Render

**Heads up:** `render.yaml` declares the **web service only** — not the database. Render's free tier only allows one Postgres per account, so we create the DB manually once and let the blueprint reference it via an env var. This also makes it easier to upgrade the DB plan independently later.

#### 2a. Create the Postgres database (one-time, manual)

1. In Render, click **New +** → **PostgreSQL**.
2. Name it `lps-mis-db` (any name works), pick whichever plan you want (free if you have the slot, starter if not), region closest to your users.
3. Click **Create Database** and wait for it to finish provisioning.
4. On the database info page, copy the **Internal Database URL** (not the External one — Internal is faster and stays within Render's network).

#### 2b. Deploy the web service via the blueprint

1. In Render, click **New +** → **Blueprint** and select this repo.
2. Render detects `render.yaml` and proposes the `lps-mis-api` web service.
3. Fill in the env vars marked "sync: false":
   - `DATABASE_URL` — paste the Internal Database URL from step 2a.4
   - `SEED_OWNER_PASSWORD` — Simon's initial password
   - `SEED_STAFF_PASSWORD` — Daniel's initial password
   - `CLIENT_URL` — leave blank for now (you'll set this after Vercel is up)
4. Click **Apply**. Render clones the repo, runs `npm install` in `server/`, then the start command which migrates + seeds + boots Express.
5. Once the service is live, copy its URL (e.g. `https://lps-mis-api.onrender.com`). You'll need it for Vercel.
6. Sanity-check the API: `curl https://<your-api>.onrender.com/api/health` should return `{"status":"ok"}`.

> **Free tier note:** Render spins down free web services after 15 min of inactivity and cold-starts take ~30s. Fine for demoing; upgrade to a starter plan if the demo needs to be instant.
>
> **Runtime note:** Render uses its native Node runtime for the API (not Docker), so `server/Dockerfile` is ignored on Render. The Dockerfile is only for local `docker compose up`.

### 3 · Deploy the client on Vercel

1. In Vercel, **Add New Project** → import this repo.
2. Set **Root Directory** to `client`.
3. Framework preset should auto-detect as **Vite**. Leave build command (`npm run build`) and output directory (`dist`) as defaults.
4. Under **Environment Variables**, add:
   - `VITE_API_URL` = the Render API URL from step 2.5 (e.g. `https://lps-mis-api.onrender.com`) — do **not** include `/api`.
5. Click **Deploy**. Vercel will build and serve the SPA.

### 4 · Point the API at Vercel (CORS)

Once Vercel gives you a URL (e.g. `https://lps-mis.vercel.app`):

1. Back in Render, open `lps-mis-api` → **Environment**.
2. Set `CLIENT_URL` to the Vercel URL.
3. Trigger a manual redeploy (or just save — Render redeploys automatically on env change).

The API will now only accept CORS requests from that origin. Done.

### 5 · First login

Visit the Vercel URL, log in as:
- **simon** with `SEED_OWNER_PASSWORD`, or
- **daniel** with `SEED_STAFF_PASSWORD`

Change the passwords from the database as soon as you can (see "Managing users").

## Running locally (Docker)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in DB_PASSWORD, JWT_SECRET, SEED_OWNER_PASSWORD, SEED_STAFF_PASSWORD
docker compose up --build
```

Open http://localhost:8080 and sign in as `simon` or `daniel`. Data persists in the `pgdata` volume; `docker compose down -v` wipes it.

## Running locally (no Docker)

Needs Node 20+ and a running Postgres 16.

**Server:**
```bash
cd server
npm install
# Set env vars in server/.env or inline:
#   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/pub_mis
#   JWT_SECRET=anything-long
#   SEED_OWNER_PASSWORD=...
#   SEED_STAFF_PASSWORD=...
npm run migrate
npm run seed
npm run dev       # :4000
```

**Client:**
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev       # :5173 — vite proxies /api to :4000
```

Open http://localhost:5173.

## API overview

All routes are under `/api`. Everything except `POST /api/auth/login` requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

| Method | Path | Role | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST   | `/api/auth/login`         | any     | Exchange credentials for a JWT |
| GET    | `/api/auth/me`            | any     | Current user from token |
| GET    | `/api/takings`            | any     | List; `?from=&to=` filters |
| GET    | `/api/takings/summary`    | any     | `{ weekTotal, monthTotal }` |
| GET    | `/api/takings/:id`        | any     | Single entry |
| POST   | `/api/takings`            | any     | Create (unique per date) |
| PUT    | `/api/takings/:id`        | any     | Update |
| DELETE | `/api/takings/:id`        | **owner** | Delete |
| GET    | `/api/events`             | any     | List; `?month=YYYY-MM` |
| GET    | `/api/events/upcoming-count` | any | Count for current month |
| GET    | `/api/events/:id`         | any     | Single event |
| POST   | `/api/events`             | any     | Create |
| PUT    | `/api/events/:id`         | any     | Update |
| DELETE | `/api/events/:id`         | **owner** | Delete |

## Managing users

Phase 1 has no user-management UI. To add a new staff user or reset a password, connect to the Render database (via Render dashboard → `lps-mis-db` → **Connect**) and use `psql`:

```sql
-- Add a new staff user
-- First generate a hash inside the API container's shell:
--   node -e "console.log(require('bcryptjs').hashSync('their-password', 10))"
INSERT INTO users (username, password_hash, role)
VALUES ('alice', '<paste the hash>', 'staff');

-- Reset someone's password
UPDATE users SET password_hash = '<new hash>' WHERE username = 'simon';

-- Delete a user
DELETE FROM users WHERE username = 'alice';
```

---

## Phase 2+ (not yet built)

The `routes / controllers / models` split on the server and the `pages/<module>/` split on the client are already module-shaped. Planned additions:

- User management UI + password reset flow
- Company documents / manuals (with file storage)
- IP / network inventory
- NAS integration for file storage
- Richer reporting and analytics
- Per-user edit history / audit log
